I started this repository as, well actually, a bit of a personal joke, but if I'm being honest I wasn't expecting it to perform as it did and I've actually made some very interesting breakthroughs locally that I need to actually confirm before pushing. However, if I'm right, we're looking at 100x speedup on vector databases, just local, with nothing more than classical computers. 

And I mean small quantum simulation, maybe 8 to 10 bits, which isn't much. It is not far away if you're a decent sized company. In fact, it's something you can actually get today if you know the right people at the right places, but you're looking at a thousand times speed up.


Imagine if anthropic or open AI could speed up their searches with nothing more than a single megabyte of overhead or less Now imagine if they could just get access to maybe eight to ten qubits And then they could speed up over a thousand And I mean economies of scale, that's millions So yeah, watch this space I guess, unless you're from one particular unfortunate area of New York
