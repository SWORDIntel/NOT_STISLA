===============================================

Version 1.0 - Effective Date: December 24, 2025

PREAMBLE
--------

This license governs the use, modification, and distribution of NOT_STISLA, a proprietary high-performance search algorithm. NOT_STISLA represents an irreversible advancement in search algorithm performance.

By accessing, using, or distributing NOT_STISLA, you acknowledge that this software represents a fundamental transformation in algorithmic capabilities, and you agree to the terms set forth below.
